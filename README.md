# Slither Blitz

Slither Blitz is a modern take on the classic Snake game, featuring acceleration mechanics for a fast-paced and dynamic experience. The game is built using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical interface.

## Features

- **Acceleration**: The snake gradually increases its speed as you play, adding a layer of challenge.
- **Classic Gameplay**: Grow the snake by consuming food, but be careful not to collide with the walls or the snake's own body.
- **Randomized Food Placement**: The food appears randomly on the grid, ensuring every round feels fresh.
