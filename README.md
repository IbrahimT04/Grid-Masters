# Grid Masters

Grid Masters is a Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Python's Tkinter library. It features a clean and simple graphical interface and utilizes object-oriented principles to manage the game logic, user interactions, and GUI components.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Built with Tkinter, offering a smooth experience for players.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Each component of the game is structured around Python classes, making the code modular, maintainable, and extendable.
- **Player vs Player Mode**: Two players can take turns playing on the same computer.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run Grid Masters, you'll need Python installed on your machine along with the required dependencies.

You can install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Game

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the game by running the `main.py` file:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will launch the Tic-Tac-Toe game with a Tkinter-based GUI.

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns placing their marker (X or O) on an empty grid space.
- The first player to align three of their markers horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
- If all grid spaces are filled and no player has aligned three markers, the game ends in a draw.

## Project Structure

- **main.py**: Contains the main entry point and game logic.
